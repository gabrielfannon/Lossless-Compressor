one day a dog named max was walking through the woods when he saw a frog named fred sitting under a banana tree max wagged his tail and said hey fred what are you doing fred looked up and said just waiting for a banana to fall max tilted his head and said but fred frogs don’t eat bananas fred smiled and said well i thought i’d give it a try max laughed and said good luck with that suddenly a banana fell from the tree and fred jumped up and tried to catch it but he missed and the banana landed on max’s head max looked up and said i guess that’s mine now fred grinned and said well you might as well eat it since you’ve got it on your head max sniffed the banana and said i’m not sure i’m a fan of fruit but i’ll give it a go max took a bite and immediately made a face yuck this banana is way too squishy fred laughed and said i told you it wasn’t for you but i guess we can make banana smoothies with it max said you can have the rest of the banana i’ll stick to my dog treats but fred said thanks max but i think i’m good with my flies max and fred sat under the banana tree for a while and laughed about how they both learned something new that day they learned that dogs don’t eat bananas and frogs don’t eat squishy fruit but they both agreed the banana tree was still a good spot for a nap the end
